# Project MAO302
This is final project of MAO302 Course make by FPT University

## Part 1: simplex method for linear program (LP)

- Generate input matrices of a standard linear program in matrix from
- Write a code to solve the generated LP using to phase simplex method in matrix form
- Solve the genarated LP by a tool such as CVX, Cplex, ...
- Repeat (1)-(3) one hundred timnes and compare the mean and standard deviation of running time of your code with those of the chosen tool.

## Part 2: Network-Type Problem

## Part 3: Interior-Point Methods

## Part 4: Integer Programming
