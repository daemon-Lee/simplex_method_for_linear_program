# Project MAO302
This is final project of MAO302 Course make by FPT University

## Part 1: simplex method for linear program (LP)

- Generate input matrices of a standard linear program in matrix from
- Write a code to solve the generated LP using to phase simplex method in matrix form
- Solve the genarated LP by a tool such as CVX, Cplex, ...
- Repeat (1)-(3) one hundred timnes and compare the mean and standard deviation of running time of your code with those of the chosen tool.

## Part 2: Network-Type Problem

Players A and B each pick a number between 1 and 100. The game is a
draw if both players pick the same number. Otherwise, the player who
picks the smaller number wins unless that smaller number is one less than
the opponentâ€™s number, in which case the opponent wins. Find the optimal
strategy for this game.

## Part 3: Interior-Point Methods

## Part 4: Integer Programming
